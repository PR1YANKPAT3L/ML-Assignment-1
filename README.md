### Virtual Environments

1. Create the virtual environment.
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

2. Activate the virtualenv and install the predefined packages. This tutorial was made for linux, but you can find the Windows translation [here](https://github.com/sealneaward/template-py#windows-setup).
```
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. You can add packages to your virtualenv and update the requirements for your project as you proceed.
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
